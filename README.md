# 🥖 Croq'Pain Case Study: Optimizing Store Locations with Regression

An applied business analytics project that uses multivariate regression modeling to predict store performance and recommend ideal locations for French restaurant chain **Croq’Pain** to expand in 1996.

---

## 📊 Project Summary

### 🎯 Objective
**Goal:** Identify optimal locations for new Croq’Pain stores by correcting errors in the original regression model and predicting store performance with an improved linear model.

---

## 🧠 Problem & Solution

### ❌ Original Model Issues
- **Multicollinearity:** Highly correlated explanatory variables (P15, P35, P45) distorted the original regression.
- **Heteroskedasticity:** Residuals violated homoscedasticity, suggesting inconsistency in model variance.
- **Insignificant Variables:** Too many variables with high p-values were included, reducing model efficiency.

---

### ✅ Improved Model
We refined the model using:
- New explanatory variables:
  - Capital investment (`K`)
  - Average income (`INC`)
  - Natural log of store size (`log(SIZE)`)
  - Natural log of non-restaurant competitors (`log(NREST)`)
  - Natural log of total population (`log(total)`)
- Diagnostic testing to confirm:
  - Normal distribution of errors
  - No multicollinearity (VIF < 5)
  - Homoscedasticity of residuals
  - No autocorrelation

## 📈 Results & Recommendations

- **Model Performance:**
  - R-squared: **0.8016**
  - Adjusted R-squared: **0.7848**

- **New Store Location Recommendations:**
  - 🏙️ Toulouse: 42.1% projected performance ratio
  - 🏙️ Montpellier: 31.9% projected performance ratio
  - 🏙️ Dijon: 34.6% projected performance ratio

## 📚 Validation Steps

1. **Multicollinearity Test:** Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values below 5 ensured no collinearity.
2. **Residual Analysis:** Homoscedasticity confirmed using residual vs. fitted plots.
3. **Autocorrelation Test:** Durbin-Watson test confirmed absence of autocorrelation.
4. **Performance Ratio Prediction:** Applied the improved model to 50 stores opened before 1994 and validated predictions on 10 new stores opened in 1994.
